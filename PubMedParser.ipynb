      "Title: Spontaneous and Vaccine-Induced Clearance of Mus Musculus Papillomavirus 1 Infection.\n",
      "Summary: We found that challenge of SKH1 mice (Crl:SKH1-Hrhr) with MmuPV1 by scarification on their tail resulted in three clinical outcomes: (i) persistent (>2-month) papillomas ( approximately 20%); (ii) transient papillomas that spontaneously regress, typically within 2 months ( approximately 15%); and (iii) no visible papillomas and viral clearance ( approximately 65%). We show that MmuPV1 challenge of the outbred immunocompetent SKH1 strain produces both transient and persistent papillomas and that vaccination of the mice with a DNA expressing an MmuPV1 E6E7L2 fusion with calreticulin can rapidly clear persistent papillomas. SKH1 mice with persistent papillomas were treated by using a candidate preventive/therapeutic naked-DNA vaccine that expresses human calreticulin (hCRT) fused in frame to MmuPV1 E6 (mE6) and mE7 early proteins and residues 11 to 200 of the late protein L2 (hCRTmE6/mE7/mL2).\n",

      "Summary: In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge of mouse models used in PCV2 research that has been performed to date, highlighting their strengths and limitations, as well as prospects for future PCV2 studies. PCV2 is considered the main pathogen of porcine circovirus diseases and porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVD/PCVAD). Mouse models of PCV2 are valuable experimental tools that can shed light on the pathogenesis of infection and will enable the evaluation of antiviral agents and vaccine candidates.\n",

      "Summary: Results of the third experiment showed that elk consumed the majority of a surrogate vaccine compounded with montmorillonite mixed in hay with oral, nasal, conjunctival, and gastrointestinal exposure to the vaccine. Remaining wildlife reservoirs are the bison (Bison bison) and elk (Cervus canadensis) populations in Yellowstone National Park and the surrounding area, from which there is periodic exposure and transmission to surrounding livestock herds. We conducted three experiments to evaluate the efficacy and practicality of delivering a killed B. abortus vaccine compounded with montmorillonite clay as a carrying agent to oral, nasal, and conjunctival mucosa.\n",

      "Summary: Here we describe the development of a candidate vaccine (YF-S0) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that uses live-attenuated yellow fever 17D (YF17D) vaccine as a vector to express a noncleavable prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen. YF-S0 has an excellent safety profile and induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), mice (Mus musculus) and cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), and-concomitantly-protective immunity against yellow fever virus. Taken together, the quality of the immune responses triggered and the rapid kinetics by which protective immunity can be attained after a single dose warrant further development of this potent SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate.\n",

      "Summary: In mice and cotton rats, treatment with ibuprofen, a nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), to decrease the chronic low-grade inflammation of the elderly immune system has proven successful in restoring the function of cytotoxic lymphocytes. Choosing an appropriate animal model to study RSV infection in the aging immune system is essential to benefit the growing population of elderly in the world. These animal models of aging have shown an age-dependent time course for clearance of virus correlating with a significantly diminished cytotoxic T lymphocyte and humoral immune response in old animals compared to adult animals.\n",
